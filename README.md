# Algorithms Study Implementations

## Overview

This repository records my journey studying classic algorithms and data structures. I revisit the same topics across multiple programming languages (currently C and Rust, with more planned) to reinforce understanding through hands-on implementations. Each language lives in its own workspace with dedicated tooling, tests, and documentation.

## Directory Structure

Every language implementation lives in its own subdirectory (e.g., `c/`, `rs/`). Consult the README within each directory for language-specific setup, tooling, and progress notes.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository, choose the language directory you want to explore, and follow the workflow documented in that subdirectoryâ€™s README.

## Roadmap

Each language subdirectory keeps its own checklist of algorithms and data structures to work through. Refer to the corresponding README for the current progress and planned additions.
